        <p>My programming journey started when I saw one of my friends who is very professional at programming.
        <p>After that, I started learning C++ language via YouTube videos. Then I chose ICT at HZ University.</p>
        <p>I don't have a lot of experience, but I still have a lot to learn, and I hope I will achieve that goal during university.</p></div>
